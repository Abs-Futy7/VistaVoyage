# Database Normalization to 100% BCNF Compliance

## Summary of Changes Made

This document outlines the changes made to achieve 100% Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) compliance in the VistaVoyage database.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **packages** Table - Decomposed for Better Normalization

**Problem**: The packages table contained multiple responsibilities violating single responsibility principle and potentially BCNF.

**Solution**: Decomposed into three tables:

- **`packages`** - Core package information (id, title, description, price, foreign keys)
- **`package_details`** - Detailed content (highlights, itinerary, inclusions, exclusions, terms_conditions)
- **`package_schedules`** - Scheduling information (duration_days, duration_nights, max_group_size, min_age, availability dates)

**Benefits**:
- Each table now has a single responsibility
- Reduced data redundancy
- Better maintainability
- Improved query performance for specific use cases

### 2. **promo_codes** Table - Removed Redundant Fields

**Problem**: Contained duplicate fields for the same information:
- `used_count` vs `current_usage`
- `usage_limit` vs `max_usage`

**Solution**: Removed legacy fields (`max_usage`, `current_usage`) and kept only:
- `used_count` - Current usage count
- `usage_limit` - Maximum usage limit

**Benefits**:
- Eliminated data redundancy
- Reduced maintenance complexity
- Improved data integrity

### 3. **bookings** Table - Normalized Payment Information

**Problem**: Contained payment-related fields that could be calculated or stored separately.

**Solution**: Created separate `booking_payments` table with:
- `total_amount`
- `paid_amount`
- `discount_amount`
- `tax_amount`
- `currency`

**Benefits**:
- Separated payment concerns from booking logic
- Allows for more complex payment scenarios
- Better extensibility for payment features

### 4. **activities** Table - Normalized Activity Types

**Problem**: Activity types were stored as strings, leading to potential inconsistencies.

**Solution**: Created separate `activity_types` table and replaced string field with foreign key:
- **`activity_types`** - Normalized activity type information
- **`activities.activity_type_id`** - Foreign key reference

**Benefits**:
- Consistent activity type data
- Better data integrity through foreign key constraints
- Easier to manage activity type categories

## New Tables Created

### 1. `package_details`
- **Purpose**: Stores detailed content for packages
- **Relationship**: One-to-one with packages
- **Key Fields**: highlights, itinerary, inclusions, exclusions, terms_conditions

### 2. `package_schedules`
- **Purpose**: Stores scheduling and availability information
- **Relationship**: One-to-one with packages
- **Key Fields**: duration_days, duration_nights, max_group_size, min_age, availability dates

### 3. `booking_payments`
- **Purpose**: Stores payment information for bookings
- **Relationship**: One-to-one with bookings
- **Key Fields**: total_amount, paid_amount, discount_amount, tax_amount, currency

### 4. `activity_types`
- **Purpose**: Normalized activity type information
- **Relationship**: One-to-many with activities
- **Key Fields**: name, description, category

## BCNF Compliance Status

### **After Normalization - 100% BCNF Compliant**

All tables now meet BCNF requirements:

1. **`users`** ✅ - All non-key attributes depend only on primary key
2. **`destinations`** ✅ - All attributes functionally depend on primary key
3. **`trip_types`** ✅ - Simple structure, all attributes depend on primary key
4. **`activities`** ✅ - Now uses foreign key for activity_type_id
5. **`activity_types`** ✅ - New normalized table
6. **`packages`** ✅ - Reduced to core package information only
7. **`package_details`** ✅ - Normalized detail information
8. **`package_schedules`** ✅ - Normalized scheduling information
9. **`package_images`** ✅ - Already compliant
10. **`package_activities`** ✅ - Junction table, already compliant
11. **`bookings`** ✅ - Removed payment fields
12. **`booking_payments`** ✅ - New normalized payment table
13. **`blogs`** ✅ - Already compliant
14. **`offers`** ✅ - Already compliant
15. **`promo_codes`** ✅ - Removed redundant fields

## Benefits of 100% BCNF Compliance

1. **Eliminated Data Redundancy**: No duplicate information stored
2. **Improved Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure consistency
3. **Better Maintainability**: Single responsibility for each table
4. **Enhanced Query Performance**: Smaller, focused tables
5. **Reduced Storage Requirements**: No redundant data storage
6. **Easier Extensions**: Normalized structure supports future features
7. **Better Data Consistency**: No update anomalies

## Migration Required

To implement these changes, run the Alembic migration:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

The migration will:
- Create new normalized tables
- Migrate existing data to new structure
- Remove denormalized columns
- Add necessary foreign key constraints

## Impact on Application Code

Applications using these models will need to be updated to:
1. Use relationship properties instead of direct field access
2. Handle the new table structure in queries
3. Update any direct SQL queries to use the new schema

## Conclusion

The database now achieves 100% BCNF compliance through proper normalization techniques while maintaining all functional requirements and improving overall data integrity and maintainability.
